		<h1> I'm learning HTML</h1>
		<p class = "bingo"> So let's start off with understanding how to make paragraphs.<br>
			You can write everything you wanna with paragraphs. Well I guess we're done with paragraphs!<br>
			Next we learn to make lists!
		</p>
		<p class = "bingo"> Adding these paragraphs after writing the code to change their font<br>
		 CSS is actually fun to learn and there's loads of stuff you can do with CSS<br>
		 I'm totally impressed by CSS Zen garden. I just hope I can make webpages that COOL someday!<br>
		 Kay time to get some really good fonts for the other paragraphs.</p>
		<h2> Let's make an ordered list first of all! </h2>
		<ol id = "ordered-list">
			<li> First item</li>
			<li> Second item</li>
			<li> Third item</li>
			<li> Aaand we're done! </li>
		</ol>
		<h2> Unordered LISTS </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> First item</li>
			<li> Second item </li>
			<li> thiiiirdd </li>
			<li> The end! </li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id = "type-3-heading"> Just a type 3 heading for fun and adding an id to it! </h3>
		<h3 id = "random-heading"> Oh yeaaaaaaaah!</h3>
		
		<p> Now let's <em>emphasize(italicize)</em> and <strong>strong(BOLD)</strong> some text.<br> </p>
		<p> Now some colouring up! I'm marking the paragraphs and headers to be coloured. Doing something with the background as well!</p>
		
		<p class = "Random-paragraphs"> #Random Paragraph 1 : Now I need multiple random paragraphs coz I need to use classes and ids in CSS and make this program a teeny bit more colourful!<br>
		Well HTML has been really so much fun so far but I guess there's still loads to explore to make a presentable cover page for our project</p>
		<p class = "Random-paragraphs">#Random Paragraph 2 : I think my partner gotta learn a lot of languages too so we make one hell of a program!</p>
		<p class = "Random-paragraphs">#Random Paragraph 3 : I'm beginning to feel like a rap god rap god oh my people from front to the back nod back nod! </p>
		<p class = "Random-paragraphs">#Random Paragraph 4 : Damn Imma miss on my Music Practice. I only pray they don't kick me outta this one!</p>
		<p class = "Random-paragraphs">#Random Paragraph 5 : Now we have quite a few random paragraphs don't we? Let's add a class to this one! </p>
